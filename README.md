Out of the total **14537** helpful reviews, **60** were Vine reviews and **14477** were non-Vine reviews.

### 2. How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

Out of the total **60** Vine reviews, **34** were 5-star reviews.
Out of the total **14477** non-Vine reviews, **8212** were 5-star reviews.


### 3. What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

![Q3](https://github.com/anupoonja/Amazon_Vine_Analysis/blob/main/AddRes/Q3.png)


**56%** of Vine reviews were 5 stars. **56%** of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.

## Summary:

**56%** of the total Vine reviewers gave 5-star rating. **56%** of the total non-Vine reviews were 5 stars too.

From the above result we can determine that there was no bias by the Vine members in giving 5-star rating.
The 5-star ratings by Vine members are same as non-Vine reviewers.

We can use the **verified_purchase** column to determine the percentage of total Vine reviewers who are verified to have purchased the product.
This will determine if the reviews are genuinely given after buying the product or not.
